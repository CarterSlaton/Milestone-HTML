            <td>Carter worked at safeway the end of his junior year to october of his senior year. He started out as
                Sanitation Crew,
                which help clean carts and the store since COVID-19 was still a big worry. However as COVID-19 died
                down,
                Carter was moved into the Online Shopper Crew. He would shop for customers and deliver the goods to
                their car. He would frequently
                find ways to take extended breaks and was well-liked.</td>
            <td>During the summer between Carter's freshman and sophmore year of college he landed at his local dollar
                tree.
                Here Carter was viewed as a model employee for just doing his job. The bar was low and by doing what he
                was asked
                he was the favorite employee in the eyes of the managers. He left this job when his sophmore year began
                and never went back
                as he said <i>"The pay was not worth the work I had to do".</i>

    <h2>Current Work</h2> <!--Current work desc.-->
    <p>Carter currently works as a babysitter for a company called BusyBees. He has worked with both
        churches and families of many kinds. Some kinds of situations he has had to deal with are:
    <ol> <!--Uses list to give examples of situations-->
        <li>Changing kids' diapers</li>
        <li>Screaming kids</li>
        <li>Parents not coming home when they said they would</li>
        <li>Carter's hair being pulled</li>
        <li>Working with a frined, but then not being put in the same group</li>
    </ol>
    </p> <!--Italicizes all quotes from Carter-->
    <p>However Carter continues to do this job as he says <i>"It pays well and the schedule is flexible so why not".</i>
    </p>

    <h2>Future Work Plans</h2> <!--Carter's plan for future work-->
    <p>As of right now, Carter is unsure of which field of software development to go into.
        He looks to be interested in whoever will pay the most. Another idea that Carter may get
        into is working on cheap, reusable mobile games. They appear to be relatively easy to program
        and remake into new games, and allows for ad revenue plus in-app purchases.
