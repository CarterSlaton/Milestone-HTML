    <hr />
    <h3>Early Beliefs</h3> <!--First part, early stage of faith-->
    <p>In Carter's early years, he attended a church in Delaware where he was put into daycare. At the time church
        was only a place where he would hope he could go on the playground. He knew almost nothing about
        his faith. However that can be accreditted to his young age. Not much is known about his beliefs in his early
        stages
        of life since no one would know the man he would turn out to be.<img src="Media/UCYCCampPic.JPG"
            alt="UCYC Group Picture" width="33%" align="right">
    </p>

    <h3>Palmcroft Days</h3> <!--Middle stage and fallout with church-->
    <p>This next stage in Carter's life transformed his faith. He moved to Arizona and met a few people.
        One of these friends whose name is Gage, led him to Arizona Hills. Arizona Hills, which is now called Palmcroft
        Anthem,
        Was the start of Carter's journey to discover his own meaning of faith. Carter got into volunteer work working
        as a helper for children's services, running lights for the adult service, and helped with <b>teardown</b>.

        </iframe>
        </br>
        </br>
        Carter grew in his faith but had found his belief was strongest when he was with others. At the time this was
        not an issue
        but once the COVID pandemic hit, Carter had slowly stopped attending church and his thirst for Christ had
        lessened.

    <h3>Revival of Faith</h3> <!--Carter's newfound faith and current spiriutal life.-->
    <p>Carter's senior year was about to start and nothing had changed. Until one of his friends from years ago who he
        kept occasional
        contact with starting inviting him to church again. His name is Kyle and with his and Gage's help, they got
        Carter back into
        consistently going to church. However, something had changed this time. Carter had found a new joy in going to
        church and in wanting
        to know more about God. He kept pushing himself leading to him running a small group and helped run a <b>VBS</b>
        where he even presented
        the Gospel to others.
        </br>
        </br>
        <u>
            This prepared Carter for college as he was able to keep his faith strong in a new enviorment. Where he now
            goes to a church called Pela and goes to GCU's chapel.</u>
